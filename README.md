This Compatibility Mod built-up project based on [Salty Simulations 747](https://github.com/saltysimulations/salty-747) and [FlyByWire A32NX Project](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx). 

This is an open-source modification for Captain Sim Boeing 777-200ER, Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 777F. Our goal is to make these CS aircrafts, which mainly based on the original Asobo Boeing 747 implementation flyable again. We decided implement this mod on top of Salty Simulation 747 and FlyByWire A32NX Project as thier main goal is also to improve the Asobo based Aircraft to an enjoyable level.
